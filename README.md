# Exp - 6 STUDENT ONLINE EXAM REGISTRATION SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement and SRS of a Student Online Exam Registration System and represent its system architecture using UML diagrams.

# SRS (Procedure):
Analyze the Student Online Exam Registration System and model its components through the following UML diagrams:

1.Use Case Diagram – Identifies actors (e.g., Student, Admin, Exam Controller) and system functionalities (e.g., Register for Exam, View Exam Schedule, Generate Admit Card).
2.Class Diagram – Represents classes such as Student, Exam, Registration, Course, and their relationships.
3.Activity Diagram – Describes workflows like exam registration by the student.
4.Sequence Diagram – Illustrates time-based interactions during tasks such as registering for an exam.
5.Communication Diagram – Highlights communication between system components like Student, Exam Controller, and Database.
6.Package Diagram – Organizes components into modules such as Student Management, Exam Scheduling, and Registration.
